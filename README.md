# Java
Introduction to Java

## COP_Java
Contains all of my object-oriented course assignments. I took this class around üçÅFall 2024 at Florida Atlantic University.
In this file, you'll find subfolders named Homework#, where you can view program files I've done as weekly assignments. 
I had written a quick summary of Java OOP as a memory refresher üßÉ, found at [COP_Java/ReadMe](https://github.com/Nani-anais/Java/tree/main/COP_Java)

### ‚ö°Ô∏èHighlights
Please take a look at [Homework4](https://github.com/Nani-anais/Java/tree/main/COP_Java/Homework4), this was my favorite program I've developed at the time! I have a ReadMe file where you can find all the information about this program, including instructions on how to run it, as well as a video demonstrating its functionality.
